# Software Comparison Tool - Development Roadmap

## Current State
The comparison tool currently uses hard-coded mock data with only 3 software options (ClickUp, Monday.com, Asana). It lacks integration with the Sanity CMS and doesn't support URL-based sharing of comparisons.

## Implementation Options

### âœ… Option 1: Quick Integration (1-2 hours) - CURRENT PHASE
**Goal:** Make it functional with real data from Sanity

**Features:**
- [x] Document improvement roadmap
- [x] Connect to Sanity to pull actual software reviews
- [x] Use real logos, scores, and features from database
- [x] Keep current UI design
- [x] Add URL parameters for shareable comparisons (`?tools=clickup,asana,monday`)
- [x] Pull comparison features from review scoring system (15-step framework)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Server component to fetch data from Sanity
- URL search params handling
- Dynamic data mapping from Sanity schema to comparison table
