3. Implement proper TypeScript types for all components
4. Add loading and error states globally

### Medium Priority
1. Write unit tests for critical components
2. Set up E2E testing with Playwright
3. Implement proper logging system
4. Add performance monitoring (Vercel Analytics)

### Low Priority
1. Document all component APIs
2. Create Storybook for component library
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline improvements
4. Implement automated accessibility testing

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Sanity CMS
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=x1zu4x72
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=[token]

# Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=[Google Analytics ID]

# Site Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://workflowautomation.net
```

## Deployment Notes

### Vercel Configuration
- **Important**: Ensure environment variables don't have trailing newlines
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `.next`
- Node version: 18.x or higher

### Known Issues
1. Environment variables on Vercel may contain trailing newlines - always use `.trim()`
2. Sanity client needs lazy initialization to avoid build-time errors
3. Image optimization requires proper Vercel configuration

## Team Notes

### Design Decisions
- Using gradient designs for visual hierarchy
- Trophy/medal system for rankings (gold, silver, bronze)
- Tabbed interface for complex information
- Mobile-first responsive approach

### Content Strategy
- Focus on "best", "top", and comparison keywords
- Each guide should have 10+ tools minimum
- Include methodology section for trust
- Always disclose affiliate relationships

### Development Workflow
1. Test locally with `npm run dev`
2. Check TypeScript with `npm run typecheck`
3. Lint code with `npm run lint`
4. Commit with descriptive messages
5. Push to main branch for auto-deployment
