    content.push(createBlock('Before diving into my experience with Asana, let me explain how I test project management software. I evaluate each tool based on six key areas: task management capabilities, team collaboration features, automation options, reporting depth, value for money, and real-world usability. I spend at least 60 days with each tool, managing actual client projects to get a true feel for daily use.'))
    content.push(createBlock('For Asana, I tested it with a team of eight people across three different projects. One was a website redesign, another was a content marketing campaign, and the third was an internal process documentation project. This variety helped me see how Asana performs in different scenarios.'))

The tool helps teams organize work, track progress, and hit deadlines without the chaos of endless email chains and scattered spreadsheets.'))
    content.push(createBlock('Think of Asana as a digital workspace where everything related to your projects lives in one place. Tasks, conversations, files, and timelines all connect in ways that actually make sense. After testing dozens of similar tools over the years, I can tell you that Asana stands out for its thoughtful design and powerful features. But it\'s not perfect, and it\'s definitely not for everyone.'))
    
    // 4. The Good - Task Management
    content.push(createHeading('The Good: What Asana Does Well'))
    
    content.push(createHeading('Task Management That Actually Makes Sense', 'h3'))
    content.push(createBlock('The first thing that impressed me about Asana was how intuitive task creation feels. You don\'t need a manual to figure out how to create a task, assign it to someone, and set a due date. It just works the way you\'d expect it to.'))
    content.push(createBlock('But here\'s where Asana gets interesting. You can break tasks down into subtasks, and those subtasks can have their own subtasks, going up to five levels deep. During my website redesign project, this was invaluable. I could create a main task for "Homepage Design" and break it down into wireframing, mockups, revisions, and final delivery. Each of those had their own subtasks with specific action items.'))
    content.push(createBlock('The dependency feature saved my team countless headaches. We could mark that the copywriting needed to be done before the design work could start. When the copy deadline slipped by two days, Asana automatically adjusted all the dependent tasks. No manual updating required.'))
    
    // 5. Multiple Views
    content.push(createHeading('Multiple Ways to View Your Work', 'h3'))
    content.push(createBlock('Not everyone thinks about projects the same way. Some people love lists. Others need visual boards. A few can\'t live without Gantt charts. Asana gives you six different views to choose from, though some require a paid plan.'))
    content.push(createBlock('I started with the List view because it felt familiar, like a sophisticated to-do list. But once I discovered the Board view, there was no going back for our content marketing project. Seeing articles move from "Ideas" to "Writing" to "Editing" to "Published" gave everyone instant clarity on where things stood.'))
    content.push(createBlock('The Timeline view, which is basically a Gantt chart, became essential for our website project. I could see how all the pieces fit together and spot potential bottlenecks before they became problems. Fair warning though: you need at least the Starter plan to access Timeline view, which feels a bit stingy considering some competitors offer it for free.'))
    
    // 6. Automation
    content.push(createHeading('Automation That Saves Real Time', 'h3'))
    content.push(createBlock('Here\'s something that genuinely surprised me. Asana\'s automation features are powerful enough that I eliminated about two hours of weekly admin work. I\'m not exaggerating.'))
    content.push(createBlock('I set up rules so that when a blog post moved to "Ready for Review," it automatically assigned to our editor, set a due date for two days out, and added it to our editorial calendar project. When she marked it complete, it moved to "Ready to Publish" and notified our web developer. These might seem like small things, but they add up fast.'))

    content.push(createBlock('The Slack integration was particularly useful. We could create tasks from Slack messages, get notifications about task updates, and even change task status without leaving Slack. The Google Drive integration let us attach files directly from Drive and even create new Google Docs from within Asana tasks.'))

    content.push(createBlock('Let\'s address the elephant in the room. Asana is expensive. At $10.99 per user per month for the Starter plan, a team of 10 will pay $1,318 per year. That\'s if you pay annually. Pay monthly and it jumps to $1,618.'))
    content.push(createBlock('But here\'s the kicker that really frustrated me. You can\'t buy a single-user paid plan. The minimum is two seats. So even if you\'re a freelancer who wants the Timeline view, you\'re paying for two users. That\'s $263 per year for features that tools like ClickUp include in their free plan.'))
    content.push(createBlock('The Advanced plan at $24.99 per user per month is where you get the really good stuff like custom fields, portfolios, and time tracking. For our team of eight, that would be $2,399 per year. Ouch.'))
    
    content.push(createHeading('One Person Per Task (And Why That\'s Annoying)', 'h3'))
    content.push(createBlock('Asana has this philosophy that each task should have one owner for accountability. In theory, this makes sense. In practice, it drove my team crazy.'))
    content.push(createBlock('We had a task for "Review and approve final designs." Both our creative director and our client needed to sign off. In Asana, we had to create two separate tasks or use a workaround with subtasks. Neither solution felt natural.'))
    content.push(createBlock('Many competing tools let you assign tasks to multiple people. Monday.com does it. ClickUp does it. Even Trello does it with the right power-up. Asana\'s rigid approach feels outdated.'))
    
    content.push(createHeading('Time Tracking Costs Extra (A Lot Extra)', 'h3'))
    content.push(createBlock('Time tracking is essential for agencies and freelancers who bill by the hour. Guess what? Asana only includes time tracking in the Advanced plan. That\'s $24.99 per user per month, remember?'))
    content.push(createBlock('Even then, the time tracking feature feels basic compared to dedicated time tracking tools. We ended up using Harvest integrated with Asana, which meant another subscription and another tool to manage. For a platform this expensive, native time tracking should be standard.'))
    
    content.push(createHeading('The Learning Curve is Real', 'h3'))
    content.push(createBlock('Despite Asana\'s clean interface, new team members struggled initially. There are so many features, views, and options that people felt overwhelmed. It took about two weeks before everyone was comfortable, and a full month before they were using it efficiently.'))
    content.push(createBlock('The terminology also confused people. What\'s the difference between a project and a portfolio? When should you use a task versus a subtask versus a section? Why are some features in the customize menu while others are in settings? These aren\'t deal-breakers, but they slow adoption.'))

    content.push(createHeading('My Final Verdict'))
    content.push(createBlock('After three months of daily use, I have mixed feelings about Asana. It\'s an exceptionally well-designed tool that can transform how teams work together. The interface is clean. The features are powerful. The automation saves real time. And the integrations are extensive.'))
    content.push(createBlock('But it\'s also expensive, complex, and sometimes frustrating. The pricing feels aggressive, especially with the two-seat minimum and time tracking locked behind the Advanced plan. The learning curve is steeper than competitors. And some design decisions, like one person per task, feel stubborn rather than smart.'))
    content.push(createBlock('Here\'s my honest recommendation. Try the free plan first. Use it for at least a month with your actual team on a real project. If you find yourself constantly hitting limitations and wanting more, the paid plans are probably worth it. If the free plan feels sufficient, or if you\'re forcing yourself to use features you don\'t need, look elsewhere.'))
