        items: [
          {
            question: 'Is ClickUp really free for unlimited users?',
            answer: 'Yes! ClickUp\'s free plan supports unlimited users with unlimited tasks. The main limitations are 100MB storage total, limited integrations, and some advanced features are restricted. It\'s one of the most generous free plans in the industry.'
          },
          {
            question: 'How steep is the learning curve?',
            answer: 'ClickUp has a steeper learning curve than simpler tools like Trello or Todoist, but it\'s more intuitive than complex platforms like Jira. Most teams are productive within 1-2 weeks, and ClickUp University provides excellent training resources. Start simple and add features gradually.'
          },
          {
            question: 'Can ClickUp replace multiple tools?',
            answer: 'For many teams, yes. ClickUp can replace project management tools, document collaboration tools, goal tracking software, and basic CRM functionality. However, it may not fully replace specialized tools like advanced CRM systems, accounting software, or design tools.'
          },
          {
            question: 'How does ClickUp handle large teams?',
            answer: 'ClickUp scales well up to several hundred users. Enterprise features like SSO, advanced permissions, and dedicated infrastructure support large organizations. Some enterprises with 1000+ users report occasional performance issues that are usually resolved with proper workspace organization.'
          },
          {
            question: 'Is my data secure in ClickUp?',
            answer: 'Yes. ClickUp is SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and uses 256-bit SSL encryption. They perform regular security audits, offer 2FA, and have a 99.9% uptime SLA. Data is backed up continuously across multiple AWS regions.'
          },
          {
            question: 'Can I migrate from another tool?',
            answer: 'Yes! ClickUp offers native importers for Asana, Trello, Monday.com, Jira, Todoist, and others. They also provide CSV import and API access for custom migrations. Their support team offers migration assistance for paid plans.'
          },
          {
            question: 'What\'s the difference between Spaces, Folders, and Lists?',
            answer: 'Spaces are the highest level of organization (like departments), Folders group related Lists (optional), and Lists contain your actual tasks. Think of it as: Workspace > Space (Marketing) > Folder (Q1 Campaigns) > List (Email Campaign) > Tasks.'
          },
          {
            question: 'Does ClickUp work offline?',
            answer: 'ClickUp has limited offline functionality. You can view cached data, but creating or editing tasks requires an internet connection. The mobile apps have better offline support than the web version, syncing changes when reconnected.'
